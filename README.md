# escapeRoomTechCamp-macbook-login
A very quick static webpage for a puzzle used in the Avengers themed escape room our team designed for Ericsson's TechCamp 2019. 

Deployed using surge on the urls: escaperoom.surge.sh (peter park's login) and escaperoom2.surge.sh (nick fury's login)

For exploration purposes: the password for peter parker's laptop is "WirelessAutomotiveDelivery" and for Nick Firy's laptop is "VirtualEnergyCommunications"
